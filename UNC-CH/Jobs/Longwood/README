Usage:

(1) Open two terminal windows, S (for server) and C (for client).

(2) In (S), compile using "gcc server.c -o server -w"
    In (C), compile using "gcc client.c -o client -w"
    
    "-w" suppresses warnings created from the minimal example
    "-o" gives different names for the compiled programs
    
(3) In (S), run "./server"

    This will block on receiving a connection from client.
    
(4) In (C), run "./client <some text>" where <some text> is the text of your choice to send to the server.

Behavior:

  If client is run with no text, seg fault
  If client is run with text, server will print the text. Both programs will exit.
 
Notes:

  server.c includes "setsockopt" which supports to socket setup in testing. 
  The lines can be commented out and the code will still run, but only once.
  See Section 4.4 for details.
