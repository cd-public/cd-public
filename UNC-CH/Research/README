Stage 1:  Curate trace

Open .vcd (same as prior weeks) in GTKWave, save relevant registers

Stage 2:  Convert to texada friendly format

Find and replace:

" -> clk $end
# -> rf_addrw
$ -> rf_dataw
% -> rf_we

Delete header

Find and replace:
1clk -> ..
0clk -> ..  // In texada, by default ".." is used to delineate changes time changes in trace files in which multiple events may happen simultaneously

Stage 3:  Splice traces

Approximately every n lines, preferrably at times in which all registers are updated, mark trace termination with "--" which is texada's default trace termination
Ideally, at this point, begin the next trace with the full update, ie:

"
...
rf_addrw491000
..
0rf_we
b11111 rf_addrw
rf_addrw492000
..
rf_addrw493000
...
""

->

"
...
rf_addrw491000
..
0rf_we
b11111 rf_addrw
rf_addrw492000
--
0rf_we
b11111 rf_addrw
rf_addrw492000
..
rf_addrw493000
...
""

I am running over multiple splice patterns.  Initially I had hoped to do a wider range, but I am currently crashing texada (I believe with memory leaks) on as few as ~1000 lines so I have stepped down to ~100 line traces.  I ran both a single 100 line trace and a trace broken at every meaningful delineation, seen here as gpr0100.vcd and grp0sing100.vcd

Stage 4:  Run on Texada

Pursuant to our discussions last week, I ran Texada this week with some new options enabled.

"--parse-mult-prop" allows multiple events to occur simultaneously, asss mentioned in Stage 3 "splicing"

"--sup-threshold" allows me to specify how frequently a property must be detected to be reported.  For now I am running at "1" which is equivalently to eliminating vacuous results.

"--print-stats" prints the level of support and level of confidence.  This will become more interesting with more interesting traces going forward and likely inform texada optimization.

Switching to a spliced model has remarkable implications - the size of the output drops from 15 to .3 MB.  I suspect this will be a meaningful optimization moving forward.  I have included snippets from both the unspliced as gpr0100.out and the entire maximally spliced file as gpr0sing100.out.
