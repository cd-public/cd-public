Extending the pre-processor.  The second half of the pipeline (configuring each cycle) is now fully automated but the first half (human readability) was still done manually (automating can be done but requires a few design decisions).

With this current model, over a trace of the rf module of length 3000 lines (60 clock cycles), GPR0 is discovered.  Longer traces and more modules did not resolve.  Changing length helped more than I expected - 3000 lines completed in about 2:30 whereas I never got the full trace to complete in the hour range.  Traditionally increasing length hadn't meaningfully effected the time cost.

This pre-processing increases the size of the file by approximately a factor of 10.
