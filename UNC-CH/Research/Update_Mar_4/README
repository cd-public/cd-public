An example to clarify what support, support potential, and confidence are.

The .in was generated manually as an example, the .out was generated with the following command:  

./texada -l -f 'G(x -> Xy)' --log-file tester1.in --print-stats --conf-threshold .01 --use-global-thresholds --out-file tester1.out

"Support" denotes the number of occurances of the pattern x -> Xy given.

"Support Potential" denotes the number of occurances of the "x" in x -> Xy, that is, the number of times the pattern could have occurred.

"Confidence" is "Support"/"Support Potential"
