An example to clarify what support, support potential, and confidence are.

Tester1 - 

The .in was generated manually as an example, the .out was generated with the following command:  

./texada -l -f 'G(x -> Xy)' --log-file tester1.in --print-stats --conf-threshold .01 --use-global-thresholds --out-file tester1.out


"Support" denotes the number of occurances of the pattern x -> Xy present in the given trace.

"Support Potential" denotes the number of occurances of the "x" in x -> Xy, that is, the number of times the pattern could have occurred.

"Confidence" is "Support"/"Support Potential"

Tester2 - 

The .in was generated manually as an example, the .out was generated with the following command: 

./texada -l -f 'G(x -> Xy -> XXz)' --log-file tester2.in --print-stats --conf-threshold .01 --use-global-thresholds --out-file tester2.out

"a"  occurs 9 times

"b"  occurs 9 times

"c"  occurs 9 times

"ab" occurs 8 times

"bc" occurs 8 times

Given:

G(a -> (Xb -> XXc))
   support: 7
   support potential: 8
   confidence: 0.875
   
"Support" same as above but considers the entire (a -> Xb) as a single term.  (verified this by adding an additional "ab" and seeing counts go up)

"Support Potential" gives number of such occurances in which a immediately precedes.

"Confidence" same as above.
