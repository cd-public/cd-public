ERROR (LM -15): license server communication error - try longer timeout

The process could not read data from the daemon within the timeout
interval.

1. Increase the timeout between the license server and the application
   client with CDS_LIC_TIMEOUT.  The default timeout is ten seconds.

      Platform            Command
      --------            -------
      UNIX                setenv CDS_LIC_TIMEOUT <seconds>
      Windows             set CDS_LIC_TIMEOUT=<seconds>

2. For fault-tolerant license servers, increase the timeout between the
   license servers by starting the license daemons with the -t option.
   The default timeout is ten seconds. To increase the timeout, follow
   these steps:

   - Modify the startup file, rc.lic, to specify the -t option of lmgrd.
     Refer to the "lmgrd" man page or the lmgrd description in the
     'Cadence License Manager' in CDSDoc for more information.

   - Restart the daemons.  See the "Stopping and Starting the License
     Daemon" section in the 'Cadence License Manager' in CDSDoc for
     more information.
