CESSATION OF UNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLE PREDATOR 

AND REAPER PROGRAM

(Orange)

WHEREAS, the usage of drones to perform strikes on 

foreign nationals with little regard for collateral

damage or efficacy of strikes; and

WHEREAS, our national security is inextricably tied

to our global reputation and stability in regions

previously destabilized by US policy; and

WHEREAS, the complex legality involved in US drones

programs greatly complicates oversight;

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED,

that the 4th Congressional District Democratic

Party supports the cessation of Unmanned Aerial 

Vehicle Predator and Reaper program.
