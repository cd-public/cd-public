PRIMARY REFORM

(Orange)

WHEREAS, animus arising from the Democratic Primary

is both unacceptable but understandable; and

WHEREAS, the Democratic Party must model fair and

free elections internally to advocate for them

in general; 

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED,

that the 4th Congressional District Democratic

Party supports primary reform including same-day

nation-wide popular vote instant-run-off primaries 

without requiring party registration.
