PROVIDING UNIVERSAL BASIC INCOME

(Orange)

WHEREAS, automation and globalization will increasingly

complicate efforts to reach full employment moving 

forward as a nation; and

WHEREAS, provision of Universal Basic Income would

greatly alleviate the regulatory burden of many

social programs and allow many Americans to become

more engaged in their communities through this

increased efficiency;

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED,

that the 4th Congressional District Democratic

Party supports providing Universal Basic Income.
