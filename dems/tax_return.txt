RELEASE TAX RETURNS

(Orange County)

WHEREAS, representative democracy hinges on the 

choices of an informed public, and

WHEREAS, tax returns provide critical insight 

into candidates for public office, and

WHEREAS, this has been a common and bipartisan

practice for decades and need merely be made

into law,

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED,

that the 4th Congressional District Democratic

Party supports requiring candidates for public

office to release tax returns.
