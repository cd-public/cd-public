END FUNDING FOR CONFEDERATE MEMORIALS

(Orange County)

WHEREAS, establishing monuments to Confederate war heroes

celebrates men who committed treason and sought to break 

the nation apart in the name of slavery^1, and

WHEREAS, Confederate monuments require taxpayer dollars: 

Even when thereâ€™s strong support at a local level for an 

individual monument, many of them exist in part by 

taxing populations that may not otherwise support them, 

but have no choice^2, and

WHEREAS, relying on federal, state, and local databases, 

the Southern Poverty Law Center took a tally of 

Confederate-related sites around the country and found 

more than 1,500 in 31 states^3,

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED,

that the 4th Congressional District Democratic

Party seeks to end funding for Confederate Memorials.
