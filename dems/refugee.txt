(Orange)

WHEREAS, in a newly globalized society, stability across

the world is in the interests of the United States; and

viewed by the international community as destablizing; and

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED,

that the 4th Congressional District Democratic

Party supports refugee resettlement programs, especially

from regions in which the United States has operated.
