VOTING REFORM

(Orange)

WHEREAS, the State of North Dakota has no voter 

registration requirement or problems with voter

fraud; and

WHEREAS, many Americans struggle to get time

off to make it to polling places on election

day; and

WHEREAS, many Americans do not possess or have

the means to acquire the severely restricted

forms of voter ID often required by voter ID

laws; and

WHEREAS, many law-abiding and productive 

Americans are denied the right to vote on 

basis of past mistakes through felony

disenfrachisement; and

WHEREAS, presidential elections receive 

significantly higher voter turnout; and

WHEREAS, free and fair elections form the 

cornerstone of American democracy;

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED,

that the 4th Congressional District Democratic

Party supports voting reform including no

voter registration or ID requirement,

designating election day a holiday, allowing

no-excuse early and mail-in ballots, ending 

felony disenfrachisement laws and consolidating

local, state, and federal elections to improve

voter turnout and decrease confusion.
