OPPOSE CAPITAL PUNISHMENT

(Orange)

WHEREAS, the Supreme Court has toyed with the

notion that Capital Punishment is cruel and

unusual and therefore unconstitutional; and

WHEREAS, there is an undeniable dimension of

racism to the death penalty in the United

States^1; and 

WHEREAS, capital punishment is frequently

costly, inefficient, inhumane, and sometimes

even meted out upon the innocent^2;

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED,

that the 4th Congressional District Democratic

Party opposes the capital punishment in North

Carolina.
