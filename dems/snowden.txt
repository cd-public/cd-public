PARDON EDWARD SNOWDEN

(Orange)

WHEREAS, Edward Snowden has performed a crucial

service for our democracy by informing the public

about classified programs; and

WHEREAS, without his intervention, James Clapper's

lies under other to Congress would never have been

exposed as untrue; and

WHEREAS, the existence of the exposed programs and

lack of appropriate oversight pose a grave threat

to American world leadership and the post-WWII

international order; and

WHEREAS, the intelligence community has been either

unwillinging or unable to provide evidence that

these leaks are in any way damaging to national

security despite assurances that they are; and

WHEREAS, Snowden is now in Russia, possibly being

held against his will, but the lack of pardon for

him obfuscates this possibility that may be crucial

to understanding Russian intentions; and

WHEREAS, many other whisteblowers may have been 

silenced by fear of retaliation despite hopes to

share information important to the public interest;

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED,

that the 4th Congressional District Democratic

Party supports the immediate pardon of Edward

Snowden.
