COOPERATION WITH THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY IN 

INVESTIGATION OF WAR CRIMES IN THE WAR ON TERROR

(Orange)

WHEREAS, United States security hinges fundamentally

on its reputation as a global leader in human rights;

and

WHEREAS, transparency and accountability would further

improve the reputation and therefore the security of 

the United States; and

WHEREAS, international accountability measures exist

but have not been applied to the possibility of war

crimes in the American War on terror;

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED,

that the 4th Congressional District Democratic

Party supports cooperation with the international

community in investigation of war crimes in the war

on terror.
