This folder contains all work and grades from my Computational Linguistics coarse.  Do note that some corresponding numbers are complicated by the fact the development of a Hidden Markov Model was split into 3 different assignments but that myself and various graders all used numbering in different ways.

For me:

HW-1 was a phonem tester.

HW-2 was an anagram finder.

HW-3 was the Hidden Markov Model.

HW-4 was an affix/anagram analyzer.

HW-5 was a compression algorithm.

HW-6 was a string edit distance algorithm.
