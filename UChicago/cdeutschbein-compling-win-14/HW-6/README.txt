SED.c:  Source code for the string edit distance algorithm

SED.exe:  SED.c compiled with gcc.

	To compile it, I used:

		gcc SED.c -o SED.exe

	To use SED.exe, I usually run: 

		./SED.exe "word1" "word2"

	This will output the cost and substitutions to stdout


theXname.txt:  output over “thenameofthegame” and “theresmyname”

Xshukuru.txt:  output over “ninakushukuru” and “unamshukuru”
