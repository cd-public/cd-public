This repository publicly presents the subset of my personal work which I:

1)  Have successfully retained, and

2)  Can present in this forum

The "UChicago" folder contains work done while I was an undergraduate at the University of Chicago.

The "UNC-CH" folder contains work done while I was a graduate student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

The "Research" folder contains work uploaded to share with my advisor.

All work presented is unaltered from the original form in which it was submitted to graders.  In some cases, grader feedback may be presented.
